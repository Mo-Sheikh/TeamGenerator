As an avid football fan, and regular player. One of the most common issues is the sorting of the teams. Not only does the team selection take up valuable playing time, teams are often unfair. This application solves this issue, as teams are randomly generated. 

Regardless of whether its 5,6,7 a side or a full on 11-a-side game, the application randomises team selection. 

e.g. if you have 20 players for a 5-a-side game, the application will generate 4 teams of 5 players, conversely the system includes exception handling, i.e. if the user chooses a 5-a-side game with 24 players, the system will prompt that this is not possible, and the user will have a chance to re-enter their data, or choose a different menu. 

The beta version of the application builds on this functionality, and there are numerous new features, including but not limited to the following:

-Option to add players along with their stats, so that player and team rating can be viewed. 

-Option to delegate players into teams that are even or as close to even as possible based on the players stats.

-Option to save and edit team selection, for easier use.

-Fixture list generation.
