As an avid football fan, and regular player. One of the most common issues is the sorting of the teams. Not only does the team selection take up valuable playing time, teams are often unfair. This application solves this issue, as teams arerandomly generated. 

Regardless of whether its 5,6,7 a side or a full on 11-a-side game, the application randomises team selection. 

e.g. if you have 20 players for a 5-a-side game, the application will generate 4 teams of 5 players.

The application includes a beta version, which is currently being worked on. Thenew features will include, adding player along with their ratings out of 10. The system then generates evenly match teams based on the players attributes. The second new feature is a fixture list.
